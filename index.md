 # I dont have a cool website, and I won't


## TOS for my packs
### By commissioning me you agree to these terms:
### Pay me a little and a little on the progress, don't pay me in the end nor at the start
### While I provide you the art you want you are not allowed to ghost me, and by that I mean not respond to me/pay me after I made the art
### You cannot claim the art was made by you nor that you own it if you don't own it
### Pushing me to do faster isn't going to make me go faster in fact it will make me go slower.
### Even if you don't like the art you have to pay me if I drew it, I always ask you how do you want it in the start and the full art can't be changed, only small things can be added which I always I ask what you want added when I show the art
### You cannot refuse to pay me after I make the art
